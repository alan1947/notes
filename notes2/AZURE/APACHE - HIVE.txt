APACHE - HIVE
-------------
possible to load data from ubuntu local storage and hdfs and azure storage account

In apache hive there are two types of tables are available 

1. Managed table 

	It is a default table 

2. External table


Partitioning and bucketing
============

Partitioning in Apache Hive is a technique used to divide a large table into smaller, more manageable parts based on the values of one or more columns, known as partition keys. This approach helps improve query performance and manageability of the data.

are the concepts in apache hive to overcome from the performance issue concept 

as per apache hive there are two types of partitioning are there 

1. Static partitioning

	 In static partitioning, you manually specify the partition column values when loading data into the table. Each LOAD DATA statement must include the partition key and its value.

2. Dynamic partitioning

	In dynamic partitioning, Hive automatically determines the partition values based on the data being inserted. You do not need to specify the partition key values manually.

division is based on folder and column value , single column and multiple column

Bucketing
=========

It is the concept that came to achieve the equal distribution of data in partitioning 
It is the concept based out of files not folder
Bucketing concept will work based out of hashing algorithm
