subquery using insert
---------------------
insert into new_employees (emp_id,emp_name) selct emp_id, emp_name from employee where hiredate > '2000-01-01'

subquery using select
---------------------
select emp_name from employee where dept_id = (select dept_id from dept where name = "sales")

subquery using update
---------------------
update employees set salary = salary * 1.1 where dept_id = (select dept_id from departments where name = "hr")

subquery using delete
---------------------
delete from employee where department_id = (select department_id from department where name = 'name')




= and IN DIFFERENCE
------------------------

SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');

	the subquery should only return a single value or else it will cause error

SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');

	the subquery could return multiple values (10,20) and no error would be shown


SCALAR SUBQUERY - will only return single value like in the case of using =

SINGLE ROW - It will return single row with multiple columns

MULTIPLE ROW - It will return values from multiple rows like in the case of IN




EXISTS AND NON EXISTS
----------------------

select name from employee as e where exists (select 1 from departments as d where e.id = d.id and d.location = 'New York')

	for each row selected by the outer query the inner query checks if the employees id and department id is same and if the location is correct


AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS - operates on a set of values
SCALAR FUNCTIONS - operates on a single value

	select len("hello") #return 5

	select round(123.456,3) # returns 123.46

	select substring("hello",1,3) #return hel


MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS - ceiling(4.2) #return 5

			floor(4.5) #return 4

			abs(-5) #return 5

			power(2,3) #return 8

			sqrt(16) #return 4

STRING FUNCTIONS - len(), upper(), lower(), replace('hello world',world,coutry), substring('hello',2,4)

DETERMINISTIC FUNCTIONS - returns same result for same input values like round(), abs(), floor()

NON-DETERMINISTIC FUNCTIONS - these functions may return different results each time they are called.

COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value in a list

NULLIF: Returns NULL if the two arguments are equal; otherwise, returns the first argument
