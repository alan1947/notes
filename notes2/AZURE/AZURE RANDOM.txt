AZURE RANDOM
-------------

Blob storage different access levels

1.Anonymous access
2.Authenticated access (Role based access)(Reader, Contributor, Owner)
3.Access Keys
4.Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
5.Access Tiers (Hot, Cool, Cold, Archive) - helps to manage costs on data access frequency and retrieval needs.

Anonymous access
----------------

Private - No anonymous access
Blob - read access to blob, container metadata remains private
Container - public read access to both blob and container



Difference between standard blob account and data lake gen2
------------------------------------------------------------

In standard blob storage flat namespace is used
No directory level are supported
No atomic operations like rename or delete a folder
Folder shown will just be a naming convention

In ADLS hierarchical namespace is used 
folder level operations are possible



PAGE BLOBS, BLOCK BLOBS AND FILE SHARES
---------------------------------------

1.PAGE BLOBS

It is made up of pages of 512 byte units that can be written from or read to separately
Optimized for low latency, high throughput workloads
used in databases that require frequent read/write operations or VHD for azure virtual machines

2.BLOCK BLOBS

Made up of blocks of 100 mb units that can be managed separately
Designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data 
Blocks are assembled into a single blob
Storing images, videos, logs, backups etc.., serving static content

3.FILE SHARES

Designed for shared file storage that can be concurrently accessed by multiple clients or applications
Uses SMB(Server Message Block Protocol) which make it compatible with both windows and Linux


INTEGRATION RUNTIMES
----------------------

AUTO RESOLVING INTEGRATION RUNTIME

Azure Integration Runtime
Self-Hosted Integration Runtime
Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.


Data Explorer Pools
--------------------
in Azure Synapse Analytics are a type of runtime specifically for managing compute resources for Azure Data Explorer.


WHILE USING SYNAPSE SERVERLESS POOL
-----------------------------------

OPENROWSET is working - it is a function used for Ad-Hoc querying - on the fly querying or querying without the  creation of schema or infra management.

Creation of external table won't work in the case of master db you have to create another db

After creating another db external table is created

Creation of internal table is not supported



Apache Airflow
--------------
Workflow management tool for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.
uses Kubernetes, celery as runtimes


copy data tool
--------------
used to create one time or scheduled pipeline to load data from different sources
