Cloud Computing in Terms of CapEx and OpEx
CapEx (Capital Expenditures): In traditional IT infrastructure, CapEx involves significant upfront investments in physical hardware like servers, storage systems, and networking equipment. These assets are owned and managed by the company, and their costs are depreciated over time1.

OpEx (Operational Expenditures): Cloud computing shifts the financial model towards OpEx. Instead of purchasing hardware, companies pay for cloud services on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis1. This means lower initial costs and greater flexibility, as expenses are based on actual usage and can be scaled up or down as needed.

VMware History
VMware was founded in 1998 by Diane Greene, Mendel Rosenblum, Scott Devine, Ellen Wang, and Edouard Bugnion in Palo Alto, California. The company's first product, VMware Workstation, was released in 1999, allowing users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

In 2001, VMware entered the server market with VMware GSX Server (hosted) and VMware ESX Server (host-less). The company was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2004 for $625 million. Later, Dell Technologies acquired EMC in 2016, and VMware continued to grow as a leading provider of virtualization software.

In 2023, Broadcom acquired VMware for $69 billion, aiming to expand its multicloud strategy. VMware has since transitioned to a subscription-based pricing model under Broadcom's ownership.
